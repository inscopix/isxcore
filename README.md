# isx-core

Library containing core functionality of the isx C++ API.
The following I/O functionality is encapsulated:

* Reading Inscopix files (`.isxd`, `.isxc`, `.isxb`, `.gpio`, `.imu`)
* Writing Inscopix files (`.isxd`, `.gpio`, `.imu`)
* Exporting Inscopix files to third-party formats (`.mp4`, `.tiff`, `.csv`, `.hdf5`)

This library can be used in C++ projects using the `isxcore.cmake` configuration file, and copying the `build/Release/modules` folder to the third party dependencies of the project. Bindings in other languages can also be created. For example, there is a python binding for this api, [pyisx](https://github.com/inscopix/pyisx).

## Supported Platforms

This library has been built and tested on the following operating systems:

|  OS | Version |
|  --------- | ------- |
| macOS   | 13 |
| Ubuntu (Linux) | 20.04 |
| Windows | 11 |

There is no guarantee this library will build on other systems.

## Setup

In order to build `isxcore`, certain third-party dependencies are required. Please contact support@inscopix.bruker.com for a link to download these dependencies for a specific OS.

### macOS 

#### Step 1: Configure terminal for Rosetta (Apple Silicon)

> **Note** If you are on an Intel machine, this step can be skipped.

For macOS machines, `isxcore` is currently only compiled for x86_64 architecture, which is problematic on Apple silicon since it has arm64 architecture. Fortunately, itâ€™s still possible to compile and execute code for x86_64 architecture with Apple Silicon thanks to [Rosetta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_(software)) - a software developed by Apple to automatically translate binaries between different architectures.

To compile `isxcore` on macOS with Apple Silicon, the Terminal app needs to be configured to always open with Rosetta. This ensures that we install the x86 version of dependencies used to compile `isxcore`. To do this:

* Open finder -> click on Applications.
* Double click on Utilities.
* Right click on Terminal -> and select Get info from the options.
* Select the Open using Rosetta check box.

> **Alternatively:** Run the rest of the commands in this guide in an x86 shell with the following command:

```
arch -x86_64 zsh
```

This command will launch an x86 shell, so any dependencies are installed in the x86 version.

#### Step 2: Install brew, cmake

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install cmake
```

#### Step 3: Install Xcode

Currently Xcode 12.4 is used to compile this library. Download this version of Xcode from the following website: [Apple Developer More Downloads](https://inscopix.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MOS/pages/2975268872/Initial+IDPS+Development+Environment+Setup+on+MacOS#:~:text=Apple%20Developer%20More%20Downloads). 

Unzip the application and drag it to the Applications folder. After that, run the following commands.

```
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

### Ubuntu 20.04

#### Step 1: Install development tools

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential autoconf automake gdb git cmake
```

### Step 2: Install gcc-7

Currently gcc-7 is required to build `isxcore`, which can be installed from apt:

```
sudo apt-get install gcc-7
```

You can configure gcc-7 as the default on your system:

```
sudo update-alternatives --remove-all gcc 
sudo update-alternatives --remove-all g++
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-7 30
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-7 30
```

Verify the default gcc is configured correctly by ensuring the version is 7:

```
gcc --version
g++ --version
```

Alternatively, you can pass this gcc version to the build command:
```
make build CMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-7 CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-7
```

In order to build IDPS, some dependencies need to be obtained from older apt repos. Add the following line to /etc/apt/sources.list
```
deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic main universe
```

Then run:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install libswresample2
```

Then remove the added line from /etc/apt/sources.list

Run the following commands to link to libz.so:
```
cd /lib64
sudo ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so.1 libz.so
```

### Windows 11

#### Step 1: Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2015

Currently `isxcore` is compiled using Visual Studio Install 2015 on Windows. Install this version of Visual Studio using one of the links below:

* [Web Installer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532606&clcid=0x409)
* [ISO Image](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=615448&clcid=0x409)

During installation, select custom installation and check the box next to C++ to install C++-related packages.

#### Step 2: Install Git Bash

Download and install Git Bash from here: https://git-scm.com/. The remaining commands should be run in a git bash terminal.

## Build

To build the library run the following command in the root of this repo:

```
make build
```

> **Note:** Ensure third party dependencies are downloaded prior to running this command. By default, the build system assumes the third party dependencies are in a folder named `third_party` under the root of this repo.

If the third party folder is located elsewhere on the machine, the path to this folder can be passed as a variable when running the build command:

```
make build THIRD_PARTY_DIR=/path/to/third/party/dir
```

## Clean

Before building, it's possible to clean the build folder by running the following target:
```
make clean
```

The build folder can be removed and the library can be built in one command as well by running the following target:
```
make rebuild
```

## Test

This library contains an extensive set of unit tests which validate the behavior of the compiled binaries. To execute unit tests, run the following command in the root of this repo:

```
make test
```

> **Note:** Ensure test data is downloaded prior to running this command. By default, the build system assumes the test data is in a folder named `test_data` under the root of this repo.

If the test data folder is located elsewhere on the machine, the path to this folder can be passed as a variable when running the test command:

```
make test THIRD_PARTY_DIR=/path/to/third/party/dir TEST_DATA_DIR=/path/to/test/data/dir
```
